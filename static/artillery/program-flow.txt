All GOTO Jumps (red dashed lines):

Line  19→150: Skip instructions
Line 190→170: Retry gun positions
Line 220→240: Wind direction handling
Line 445→430: Invalid input retry
Line 590→750, 670→750, 690→750: Trajectory exits
Line 840→930, 890→930: Post-hit flow
Line 950→150: Restart game


2. Subroutines - Detailed view of all 6 subroutines:

GOSUB 1060: Check mountain collision
GOSUB 1060: Check mountain collision with boundary checks
GOSUB 1160: Draw explosion
GOSUB 1160: Draw explosion animation (5-point star pattern)
GOSUB 1290: Draw player indicator
GOSUB 1290: Draw player turn indicator with logic branches
GOSUB 1440: Draw mountain
GOSUB 1440: Generate and draw random mountain terrain
GOSUB 1580: Display wind direction message
GOSUB 1580: Print wind direction
GOSUB 1630: Set player starting position
GOSUB 1630: Switch player position

6 Subroutines are shown on the right side with their functionality and RETURN paths (purple dotted lines).

The diagram uses color coding for different block types (initialization, input, loops, decisions, subroutines) making it easy to understand the program's structure and control flow at a glance.


3. Complete Structure - High-level overview showing:

Game and projectile loops
All subroutine calls
Win conditions and scoring
Play again flow
The diagrams use color coding:

🟢 Green: Start/End
🟡 Yellow: Decisions
🟠 Orange: Loops
🔴 Pink: Subroutine calls
⚪ Default: Process blocks
The interactive tabs make it easy to navigate between different views of the program structure!
