cd C:\RubyDevKit

Auto-detect Ruby installations and add them to a configuration file for the next step.

ruby dk.rb init

Install the DevKit, binding it to your Ruby installation.

ruby dk.rb install


gem update && gem cleanup

bundle clean --force


jekyll build
jekyll build --watch
jekyll build -w
jekyll serve
jekyll serve --watch
jekyll serve -w


$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll serve

gem install wdm

Alternatively, if you use a Gemfile, you can check if Jekyll runs on Windows and only then install the wdm Gem.

gem 'wdm', '~> 0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?


May still not work
If you try to run jekyll build --watch or jekyll serve and the output directory already exists, Jekyll sometimes fails to build the site. If you encounter this problem, you can work around it by adding --force_polling to the end of your Jekyll command. See the discussion in twbs/bootstrap#14746 and jekyll/jekyll#2926 for more information.

Jekyllâ€™s auto-regeneration feature sometimes does not work at all. jekyll/jekyll#2529 suggests it fails on 32-bit systems and there is no known workaround. As of Jekyll v2.4.0, if your system is affected by this problem, you need to manually disable the auto-regeneration feature when you want to serve a site using Jekyll by running jekyll serve --no-watch.
