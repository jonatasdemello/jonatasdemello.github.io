# This is a new test 01

Here are some steps to help you learn a new skill:

1. Deconstruct the skill
2. Learn enough to self-correct
3. Remove practice barriers
4. Practice at least 20 hours

So, before you pick a skill to focus on this month, your first step should be identifying those that will be most important for your future. Ask yourself:

* What gaps in knowledge do I have for my job (or the job I want)?
* What skills do those around me (and above me) have that I don't?
* What gaps in knowledge are there on my team that I could fill?
* What characteristics does my boss value most?
