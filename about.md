# About

I am a Software Engineer and now an Engineering Manager with 25+ years of experience.

I started my career with an internship at Siemens in 1996 while still studying Computer Science at the University.
Since then I have worked at many companies big and small, including Volvo and Siemens and also at different areas including education, banking and government.
I started with IT support and helpdesk, installing and configuring computers and networks, then later moved to web and development. Today I am an Engineering Manager and my focus is on improving other people.

## Reason and Purpose

The reason I am writing this blog is to keep track of thoughs, experiences and lessons learned. This is meant to be my point of view only and how I see the world. I can and will be different for other people and by no means it is the ultimate truth â€“ not even for me, because the way I realize things changes over time.

The purpose of writing this blog is to improve my writing skills, to help me build some authority in my area of expertise and maybe help someone else.
