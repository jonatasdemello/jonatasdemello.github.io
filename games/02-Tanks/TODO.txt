Ideas for improvements

Taking inspiration from both the original and genre evolutions like Worms you could add all manner of fun:

- An AI opponent to shoot back at you!
- Add a random wind effect, throwing your bullet off course
- New weapons (Holy hand grenades anyone?)
- Randomly create the landscape instead of using a PNG
