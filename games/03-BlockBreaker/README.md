_**Creating a Brick-breaker Game With Phaser**_ is the result of teaching HTML5 game development by example at a local institute, focused on web technologies with a philosophy of _teaching concepts, methodologies and standards_ in a practical way.

This book is intended to be a hands-on introduction to HTML5 game development using the Phaser framework by developing a *complete* game with well-known mechanics. It is bundled with all the necessary assets, so we can focus on the code and not finding extra resources or developing "programmer artwork".

## What you will learn

By the end of the book, you'll have learned to:

* Set up an organized file structure for developing games for the web
* Create a blank game and test everything runs OK
* Import images and sounds
* Show and move sprites on the screen
* Manage a group of sprites
* Play sound effects and background music
* Show text on the screen with custom web fonts
* Handle touch and keyboard input
* Detect collisions and use the Arcade physics system
* How to start using the particle system
* Manage game states
* Create a "loading" screen
* Optimize the game for mobile devices

You can play a version of this game on [itch.io](pctroll.itch.io/html5-breaker), where you can also find the Android version.

## Target audience

It is aimed to programmers with some experience with JavaScript and want to learn by doing (*and finishing*). It is not a guide to JavaScript, but each step is explained and the source code is well-commented so you can get it right away and keep focusing on the big picture.
