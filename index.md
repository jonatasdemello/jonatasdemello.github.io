This is my personal site using Jekyll.

Personally I prefer to have more control over the output (html & css) and I like to keep things simple
but since Github works well with Jekyll I decided to give it a shot.

I want to explore the use of templates and leverage it for blogging, starting with my .md files.

Also, I am not an expert in UI and Front-End, my expertise in on the Back-End.
A black screen with green or yellow text is all I need!
